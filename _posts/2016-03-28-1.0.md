Major upgrade for the script.

* Support for dash-streams on svtplay
* New video id for dplay
* Postprocessing with `--remux`. it will change the container from ex: .ts to .mp4
* Download embedded videos from lemonwhale, solidtango and picsearch/screen9
* .exe file for windows. No need to install python to use the script.
* apt repo for debian/ubuntu-based distros. [https://apt.svtplay-dl.se](https://apt.svtplay-dl.se)
* i recommend installing ffmpeg or lib to be able to use remux.
* You need it also to merge video and audio files from dash-streams into one single file.
