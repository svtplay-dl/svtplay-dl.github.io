A lot of new things in this version.
Support for download videos from:
* viafree.se/.no/.dk, pokemon.com ,riksdagen.se, filmarkivet.se, viasatsport.se and flowonline.tv
* Support for twitch clips.
* Using `-A` with sista-chansen and genre on svtplay, it will download every video on that page.
* In some sites we can download more then one language in subtitles, download the raw subtitles.
* Support for merging subtitles into the .mp4 file. you need to have ffmpeg to that.
* on another thing. in the next major release 2.0, we will no longer support python2. We will release 2.0 around new year.
